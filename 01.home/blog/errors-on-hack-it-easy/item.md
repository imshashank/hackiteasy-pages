Sorry for errors……..  
We are soon going to move on some private host and abandon blogger for ever…  
We have been facing problems with blogger for many days now, and when my blog’s background turned black , i was just too much, so very soon we will move on to some hosting company…  
And also we will move the blog to wordpress.org

During this porcess the domain hackiteasy.com may be closed for some days.. But you can still access the blogspot blog from hackiteasy.blogspot.com

Go to our new site- shankee.com
