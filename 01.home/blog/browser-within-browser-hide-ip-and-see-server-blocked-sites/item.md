 Recently my friend complained that his college server blocked a few sites. and he could no longer[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_V2JZuLkPrjQ/SPg1kVOsVjI/AAAAAAAAD-4/f_zgNkwqupQ/s200/bitty.bmp)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_V2JZuLkPrjQ/SPg1kVOsVjI/AAAAAAAAD-4/f_zgNkwqupQ/s1600-h/bitty.bmp) access them from the Internet. So i thought of a solution. As the simple site blocking is by using URL. So i searched for a site that works as a browser, and now this works fine for him. I found a lot of sites but these are the best i liked of them all..
