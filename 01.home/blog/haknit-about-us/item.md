Haknit is just an individual attempt to bring about the world a decent blog about stuff about Computer that people would love to know.  
I try with my full effort in delivering and sharing all the knowledge i have gained so far about Internet, Computer, hacking and all stuff related to Computers..  
I update it very frequently and let you know the stuff i learn each day.  
Get on this ride with me and explore the world as i discover things which you thought never existed.

I am based in India with dreams of working with the topmost software giants and owning a company based in the Silicon Valley.1

About Haknit  
Its just my passion about computers that led to create this blog. I wanted to show the world the awesome things you can do with your computer. My friend once said i am bored with my computer as i have nothing new to do except games and movies..  
I thought is it all that you do with a PC see movies , listen songs..and play games..  
Ya that too but computer is much more than just this..  
I love to make my computer work as i want it to..  
Tweaking..and speeding up things..  
exploring what new tricks can do..new software..  
And people started calling me Hacker…  
Also there are a lot of misconceptions about Hacking a terms often used in place of Cracking.  
Cracking is meant for commercial profit and other stuff.. but hacking is for your self-pleasure, to explore and do all sorts of new stuff…

I had previosly owned a blog called Hackiteasy but that went off too far in Hacking and was approaching towards the dark side so i no longer update it. But it is still there you can see that by yourself.  
  
Contact me  
On any confusion or any stuff you want to ask me you can mail me any time..  
I am giving you my personal mail as i care a lot for all my fans and blog appreciators.
