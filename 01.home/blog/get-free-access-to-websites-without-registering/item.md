###  

 Get free access to websites without registering..

Go to

-http://bugmenot.com/

and type the URL of the website you want to log into.  
Examples:

-http://www.nytimes.com/, -http://www.winnetmag.com/  
etcetera.

Another (and better) way is changing the user agent of your browser to:  
Googlebot/2.1+

-http://www.googlebot.com/bot.html

This is very easy in Mozillaâ€™s Firefox. Download and install the User Agent Switcher from

-http://www.chrispederick.com/work/firefox/useragentswitcher/  
and add the Googlebot user agent.

Have fun, Dead Dreamer!
