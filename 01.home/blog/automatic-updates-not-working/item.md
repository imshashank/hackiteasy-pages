Automatic updates were disabled when my PC was infected from a Virus, I removed the virus file using AVG and even [fixed the task manager](http://haknit.blogspot.com/2008/11/task-manager-enabledisable.html). But the the virus [![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_V2JZuLkPrjQ/SSLlCedSiHI/AAAAAAAAEhE/WPiL8PEqeyU/s320/logo_windows.gif)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_V2JZuLkPrjQ/SSLlCedSiHI/AAAAAAAAEhE/WPiL8PEqeyU/s1600-h/logo_windows.gif)disabled my autmomatic updates . So i used the following trick to fix the registry and update files.

The steps are listed below.

Also the best part is that these have been generated by Microsoft only and were mailed to me when i asked them for.

Follow these steps to fix Automatic Updates

1. Download the text file from any of these

http://rapidshare.com/files/165015378/outgoing\_WUFix.txt

or

http://www.wikiupload.com/download\_page.php?id=74629

2. Rename the file from .txt to .bat file.

3. Click on the file ..

A window will pop up and will fix the Automatic Update files by itself.
