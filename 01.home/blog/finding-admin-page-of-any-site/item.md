A web site can easily be hacked if you know the hack the admin of the website. So for that you need to know the admin page of the website. And that could be a headache sometimes.

  
So here is a page made by a hacker that works for you and searches the site for the admin page.

<http://sc0rpion.ir/af/>

Just go to the site and enter the url of the site or blog followed by a  “/” and it would search for all those pages it thinks to be admin pages. Quite simple.

How it works-  
The site has a huge list of commonly occurring admin pages common on the web. So the site just adds those one by one and tests whether and page by that name exists or not.  
If there is any admin page it would show up.

Go to our new site- shankee.com
