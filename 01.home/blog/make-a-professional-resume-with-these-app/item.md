A nice, compact interface lets you create, edit, and manage your resume, while also searching job listings and creating job-search agents. More of job-search assistant than a resume builder, JobTabs uses a tree-style navigation with Search Agents for various industries and online career resources. Advanced search features let you narrow down your searches, while other tabs provide resume guidance and industry information about necessary training.

More than 25,000 resume and cover-letter templates provide a wide range of styles and formats for nearly any sort of job application.

The software name has strong educational connotations, but the program works for many industries and lets users capture job offers directly through the application. A form-based approach lets users enter all of their work history, personal information, experience, and skills, transforming all of your data into a polished one-page paper. Keyword shortcuts make composing cover letters a breeze.

For users who learn visually, this shareware app uses a multimedia approach to creating and editing your resume. Start out by simply copying and pasting your career information and personal data, decide what sort of jobs you are interested in pursuing, and before you know it, you’ve got a formatted Word document that should work for many professional job applications.

This online tool lacks some of the fancy features of its downloadable counterparts, but for speed and ease of use, it’s hard to beat. Pick from several templates, enter your contact info, experience, qualifications, and skills, and you can quickly print or save a digital copy of a simple, stylish resume. The site is supported by the now ubiquitous Ads by Google and an occasional pop-behind, but there’s no upsell, and the site also lets you create six different styles of cover letters.
