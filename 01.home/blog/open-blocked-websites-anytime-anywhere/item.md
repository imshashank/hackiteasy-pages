This cool software can be easily made to run directly from a pen drive and is really great and lets you surf any site that has been blocked by your server.  
To do this just download see the full post.  
  
**  
What is JAP?**  
JAP or Jondo is software application  
that allows you to surf the web without being observed. JAP has to be installed on the user’s computer to allow him to surf the web anonymously and without being observed. This is necessary since all requests and all of the servers’ answers have to be sent not directly to the web server, rather via a so-called Mix Cascade. These mixes are interposed stations, and all messages are directed through these stations.

Since many users make use of the anon service at the same time, the internet connections of each user are hidden among those of all the other users. Every user could have been responsible for any connection. Nobody, no outstanding person, no other user, not even the operator of the AN.ON service can determine which internet connections were requested by a certain user.

**Open Blocked Websites – Anytime, Anywhere**

- Download [Jondo](https://www.jondos.de/files/downloads/japsetup.exe) (a.k.a JAP)

**I have Downloaded JAP. What’s Next?**

- Now install the program on the computer from where you want to surf the blocked websites.

- **Note** – You will need JAVA Runtime to run JAP.

![Step 1 - Configure Jondo](http://www.orkutplus.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/step-1.png "Step 1 - Configure Jondo")

- Now open the program and choose **Assistant** (please refer screenshot).

![Choose Your Browser](http://www.orkutplus.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/browser.png "Choose Your Browser")

- Please follow the instructions for your preferred browser.
- **Note **– Firefox users should set up a new profile ( because for the profile with which you will set up this application, would only work when this application works. Making a new profile would allow you to surf with other profile normally when this application is not in use.

- Once you have configured your browser (or profile) choose in services dropdown, Free Services option.

![Choose Your Desired Free Service](http://www.orkutplus.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/step-3.gif "Choose Your Desired Free Service")

- Once you choose your desired service, wait till it connects.
- Once you see the signal, start browsing on the browser you configured with Jondo.
