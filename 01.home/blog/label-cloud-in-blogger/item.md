Use a simple code to display a cloud of labels from all your posts with the most repeated one shown with the largest font. See the Label cloud that you can see at the lower right corner..It’s so cool it shows the largest used label the widest and biggest, reducing the overall space used by labels and helping users to figure out ways to better explore your site/blog.  
Took me a lot of time to get over those HTML errors..but now its fine..as you can see that here..

Here’s how u do that..

Go to Edit layout..  
and then to Edit html..  
A good option would be to save the full template to do that click on..  
Download Full Template..
