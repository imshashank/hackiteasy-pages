 What is Second Life? 

![](http://secondlife.com/_img/spacer.gif)

 Second Life® is a 3-D virtual world created by its Residents. Since opening to the public in 2003, it has grown explosively and today is inhabited by millions of Residents from around the globe.

- From the moment you enter [the World](http://secondlife.com/whatis/world.php) you’ll discover a vast digital continent, teeming with people, entertainment, experiences and opportunity. Once you’ve explored a bit, perhaps you’ll find a perfect parcel of land to build your house or business.
- You’ll also be surrounded by [the Creations](http://secondlife.com/whatis/creations.php) of your fellow Residents. Because Residents retain intellectual property rights in their digital creations, they can buy, sell and trade with other Residents.
- [The Marketplace](http://secondlife.com/whatis/marketplace.php) currently supports millions of US dollars in monthly transactions. This commerce is handled with the inworld unit of trade, the Linden™ dollar, which can be converted to US dollars at several thriving online Linden dollar exchanges.

 Welcome to the Second Life world. We look forward to seeing you inworld.

 The World 

![](http://secondlife.com/_img/spacer.gif)

The most important thing about the Second Life world is that it is constantly changing and growing. Here’s why:

- Thousands of new residents join each day and [Create an Avatar](http://secondlife.com/whatis/avatar.php)
- Those avatars [Explore](http://secondlife.com/whatis/explore.php) the World and [Meet People](http://secondlife.com/whatis/meet.php)
- These people discover the thousands of ways to [Have Fun](http://secondlife.com/whatis/fun.php)
- Some people decide to purchase [Virtual Land](http://secondlife.com/whatis/land.php), which allows them to open a business, build their own virtual paradise, and more!
- Linden Lab creates new land to keep up with demand. What began as 64 acres in 2003 is now over 65,000 acres and growing rapidly.

 The Creations 

![](http://secondlife.com/_img/spacer.gif)

 The Second Life world is a place dedicated to your creativity. It’s about dreaming of something one moment and bringing it to life the next. Everything in Second Life is resident-created, from to the strobe lights in the nightclubs to the car (or spaceship) in your driveway.

 Imagine tinkering with the steering and handling program of a motorcycle while your friend tweaks the shape of the fuel tank and gives it a wicked flame paint job, in-world and in real-time, before you both take it for a spin down a newly created road to look for some land to buy. Have you ever wondered what it would be like to have a pair of black leather wings? Build them and give it a go.

The Marketplace



![](http://secondlife.com/_img/spacer.gif)
- Make real money in a virtual world. That’s right, **real money**.
- Here’s how it works:
- The Second Life world has a fully-integrated [economy](http://secondlife.com/whatis/economy.php) architected to reward risk, innovation, and craftsmanship.
- Residents create their own virtual goods and services. Because residents retain the [IP rights](http://secondlife.com/whatis/ip_rights.php) of their creations, they are able to sell them at various in-world venues.
- [Businesses](http://secondlife.com/whatis/businesses.php) succeed by the ingenuity, artistic ability, entrepreneurial acumen, and good reputation of their owners.
- Residents who have amassed lots of Linden™ dollars are matched with residents who want to buy Linden dollars at the [LindeX™](http://secondlife.com/currency/) exchange (our official Linden dollar exchange), or at other unaffiliated third-party exchanges.
- The Second Life real estate market provides opportunities for Residents to establish their own communities and business locations. See [Land Pricing & Use Fees](http://secondlife.com/whatis/landpricing.php) for details.
