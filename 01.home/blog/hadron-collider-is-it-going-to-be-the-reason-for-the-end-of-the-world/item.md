Is it going to be the reason for the end of the world.[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_V2JZuLkPrjQ/SMP7aM5wtYI/AAAAAAAACwU/m3FE6URtTkc/s320/hadron-collider-4.jpg)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_V2JZuLkPrjQ/SMP7aM5wtYI/AAAAAAAACwU/m3FE6URtTkc/s1600-h/hadron-collider-4.jpg)  
Or just some stupid speculations..  
Its the world’s biggest particle collider..  
And is believed to solve the greatest mysteries of the universe.Like the formation of universe and why gravitation so weak as compared to other forces.The experiment starts tomorrow but the main would start from 2009 onwards..

The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is the world’s largest particle accelerator complex, intended to collide opposing beams of 7 TeV protons. Its main purpose is to explore the validity and limitations of the Standard Model, the current theoretical picture for particle physics. The LHC was built by the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), and lies under the Franco-Swiss border near Geneva, Switzerland.

The LHC is the world’s largest and the highest-energy particle accelerator. It is funded and built in collaboration with over eight thousand physicists from over eighty-five countries as well as hundreds of universities and laboratories. The idea of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), began in the early 1980s. The first approval of the project by the CERN Council occurred in December 1994 and the first civil engineering construction work began in April 1998[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_V2JZuLkPrjQ/SMP7ZY6FvwI/AAAAAAAACv0/mEiCUL6CRWg/s320/25005101.jpg)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_V2JZuLkPrjQ/SMP7ZY6FvwI/AAAAAAAACv0/mEiCUL6CRWg/s1600-h/25005101.jpg)  
When activated, it is theorized that the collider will produce the elusive Higgs boson, the observation of which could confirm the predictions and missing links in the Standard Model of physics and could explain how other elementary particles acquire properties such as mass. The verification of the existence of the Higgs boson would be a significant step in the search for a Grand Unified Theory, which seeks to unify three of the four known fundamental forces: electromagnetism, the strong nuclear force and the weak nuclear force, leaving out only gravity. The Higgs boson may also help to explain why gravitation is so weak compared to the other three forces. In addition to the Higgs boson, other theorized particles, models and states might be produced, and for some searches are planned, including supersymmetric particles, compositeness (technicolor), extra [![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_V2JZuLkPrjQ/SMP7Zs1TTHI/AAAAAAAACv8/rgD-jyHGve4/s320/2163618172_6e7d2ec0dd_o.jpg)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_V2JZuLkPrjQ/SMP7Zs1TTHI/AAAAAAAACv8/rgD-jyHGve4/s1600-h/2163618172_6e7d2ec0dd_o.jpg)dimensions, strangelets, micro black holes and magnetic monopoles.
