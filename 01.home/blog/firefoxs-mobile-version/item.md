[![Firefox Mobile](http://www.blogcdn.com/www.downloadsquad.com/media/2008/08/fennec-m6.jpg)](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Mobile/Fennec/Releases)

Mozilla CEO says the first Alpha version of Firefox Mobile will be available in a few weeks. That’s pretty exciting. After the Opera, Safari, chrome.. its turn for Firefox to go mobile… But still i got no idea why they delayed the mobile version…  
  
It’s not clear exactly what devices or operating systems will be supported by the early Alpha. Pre-alpha releases of the browser, code-named Fennec, are already available. But at the moment, they only run on the Nokia N810 internet tablet.  
Mozilla does plan to make a Windows Mobile version of Firefox Mobile available. Still the date is not clear of whether its going to come in a few weeks or might take long.
