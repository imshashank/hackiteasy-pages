Here are the new services i try myself….they pay me double the old ones…

- [5bux  
](http://5buxs.cn/register.php?r=imshashank)
 Just click ads and you get paid for each ad you click.

- [CashFiesta](http://www.cashfiesta.com/php/join.php?ref=imshashank)
You get paid for displaying a small bar at you screen, leave it as it is and continue to do your work

Great site It pays you for making blog.. and posting posts, Its like Orkut or MySpace but it pays you for all you do on it.Go make a blog here and get paid.


hi i just figured a few ways to easy earn from the internet…  
its a good thing if u have a lot of time.. and have low cost net…  
well the lost of sites i selected are as follows…  
[bux.to](http://bux.to/?r=imshashank)[

matrixmails](http://www.matrixmails.com/?p=default&rid=159632)

Certainly the best of them all………..  
well i just have t click on some links and wait for about 20-30sec. on each.. and i get paid for that…  
they pay you $0.02 for each ad, that might seem small but when you click 12 ads daily and do that for a long time thats lot of money….

That is the second best , as i still hate the bar at the bottom of my screen..  
here it does so by placing a bar at the bottom of ur screen and u hav to do notin but just load the bar….  
an it earns for u. wile u do anythin at all  
It pays about $0.6to$1 per hour…

[Adsense](http://www.google.com/adsense)  
This is the place where i have heard rags to riches stories…  
This is from google and really pays a lot…  
But for that u need to own a site or a blog and have to work really hard on that so that u get a lot of pageviews…
