So we have the latest version of the Internet Explorer the most [![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_V2JZuLkPrjQ/SL1ecaGzMTI/AAAAAAAACrI/QSu490LMvCo/s200/screenshot_newtab.jpg)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_V2JZuLkPrjQ/SL1ecaGzMTI/AAAAAAAACrI/QSu490LMvCo/s1600-h/screenshot_newtab.jpg)used browser across the Globe.  
It is definitely faster than Mozilla Firefox, but at the cost of memory usage.  
I liked the colorful tabs. It may hang up your system a bit but that would be OK after a few seconds.  
The IE8 has been built for faster and more advanced systems preferably as more advanced and high on graphics sites are being launched their arise a need to more features.

Consuming twice as much RAM as Firefox and saturating the CPU with nearly six times as many execution threads, Microsoft’s latest beta release of Internet Explorer 8 is in fact more demanding on your PC than Windows XP itself, research firm Devil Mountain Software found in performance tests. Accroding to the firm, which operates a community-based testing network, IE8 Beta 2 consumed 380MB of RAM and spawned 171 concurrent threads during a multi-tab browsing test of popular Web destinations.
