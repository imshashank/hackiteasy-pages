I had an original version of Vista but it didn’t ran well as my friend used it on his computer..  
then i figured these tricks to activate my version  
VISTA BUSINESS PRODUCT KEYYFKBB-PQJJV-G996G-VWGXY-2V3X8

vista hack off user account….  
Open command prompt (Windows key + R) and type this command :cscript C:windowssystem32slmgr.vbs -ipk . This will allow you to modify the product key. Now enter :cscript C:windowssystem32slmgr.vbs -ato to activate Windows Vista and :cscript C:windowssystem32slmgr.vbs -dlv to verify the status of the activation. And you’re done.

To extend, reset or restart the initial OOB grace period of Windows Vista to another 30 days, use the following steps:  
Click on Vista Start button and key in Cmd in Start Search box.  
Press on Ctrl-Shift-Enter to open Command Prompt with administrative credentials (equivalent to &#147;Run as Administrator&#148;).  
In the Command Prompt, type the following command and press Enter when done: slmgr -rearm or you can use sysprep /generalize  
Reboot the computer.  
Rearm again when the remaining activation grace period timer counts down to 0 days.  
Rearm option resets the computer&#146;s activation timer and reinitializes some activation parameters.
