Iphone was the talk of the last year, but undoubtedly the year 2009 is destined to be the year of The Android. With Samsung just announcing its next smart phones to have Android. Samsung’s smart phone is supposed to be a touch-screen phone much similar to its smart phone – Omnia and Instinct. The phone is going to be a full touchscreen with a few buttons only. We could only wait and watch for the next generation of Google phones.
