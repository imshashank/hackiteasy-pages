I read all types of sources like the electric-hybrid engine, solar powered, Fuel cell or hydrogen powered but i came with the conclusion that the most practical and possible is the compressed air engine. It runs just on cylinders of compressed air and emits just air.

It uses compressed air only and uses that to drive the engine’s piston up and down. The greatest thing is that it emits only clean air. This is the most practical as many cars have already been made using this principle. The stats that i got were that in a cylinder the car would go about 200 miles with a top speed of 60 miles/hour and believe me that’s quite impressive.

A compressed air car is an alternative fuel car that uses a motor powered by compressed air. The car can be powered solely by air, or combined (as in a hybrid electric vehicle) with gasoline/diesel/ethanol or electric plant and regenerative braking.  
Tata Motors signed an agreement with MDI to continue research on air powered motors and cars. The time line for bringing their compressed air car, [the Tata OneCAT](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_V2JZuLkPrjQ/SRbxi6dwkNI/AAAAAAAAEgc/ugYIHvx4pRY/s1600-h/800px-Catvertroquette.jpg), to market has been said to be in 2008 or 2009. Other companies are also working on air cars.[](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_car)
