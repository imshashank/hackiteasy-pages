I tried soo hard to solve a rubik’s cube but could noe end up completely. I ended up doing the 3 levels but got stuck at the 4th one…  
But you don’t have to worry until Haknit is there.. See the simple tutorial videos that let you know how to solve the Rubik’s cube the easiest way. But it sure need a lot of practice.
