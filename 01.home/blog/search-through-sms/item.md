Search through the web using SMS from Airtel. Bharti Airtel along with Affle has announced a twist to our traditional SMS behaviour —[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_V2JZuLkPrjQ/SNevUGXgv9I/AAAAAAAADWI/uWup9gewA40/s320/93449_airtel.jpg)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_V2JZuLkPrjQ/SNevUGXgv9I/AAAAAAAADWI/uWup9gewA40/s1600-h/93449_airtel.jpg) one that introduces Internet search through SMS.

Set to redefine SMS to ‘Short Message and Search 2.0’ (SMS2.0), this upgrade service will allow users to trigger search from the same old SMS screen eliminating the need to open browsers. It will enable users to search — Airtel Live, the Internet, do a local search, look for jobs, and for property listings.  
See the illustration below:

The SMS2.0 application is available to Airtel users for free and can be downloaded by sending an SMS “SMS2” to 543210. This search integrated SMS2.0 has been conceptualized and developed by Affle, which is a mobile media company.
