If you are love WordPress and based in India, this is an opportunity you should not miss because, other than improving your WordPress skill-set, you will get to meet WordPress creator [Matt Mullenweg](http://ma.tt/) who is travelling all the way from US just to attend this event.

[WordCamp events](http://central.wordcamp.org/) include discussions and presentations on [everything WordPress](http://www.labnol.org/tag/wordpress/) and the one happening in New Delhi, India should be no different. You may also check these [pictures](http://flickr.com/photos/tags/wordcamp/interesting/) and [videos](http://wordpress.tv/category/wordcamptv/) to get some good idea about WordCamps in general.

The venue for [WordCamp India](http://india.wordcamp.org/) has been finalized but registrations aren’t open yet – it will be a paid event and you can follow [this link](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=wordcamp+india) to get more updates from the organizers.

## WordCamp India Venue

The address is: Adobe Towers, I-1A, City Centre, Sector : 25A, NOIDA-201301
