Thinking of buying a phone like me but couldn’t afford a high-end phone don’t worry here’s the best mobiles i found while searching a right phone for me..I recommend selecting from these two phones coz i am also going to have one out of these , help me by telling which one would be better.. write comments..

1. Motorola A810[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_V2JZuLkPrjQ/SQVUsELoiII/AAAAAAAAEVY/qFPkUabrolA/s320/motorola-a810-press-02.jpg)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_V2JZuLkPrjQ/SQVUsELoiII/AAAAAAAAEVY/qFPkUabrolA/s1600-h/motorola-a810-press-02.jpg)  
Finally, a full-featured, touch screen mobile device at an affordable price! A810 makes it easy to connect with friends or family and share important moments. An easy to use touch screen interface with access to e-mail and Internet, make it simple to manage your busy professional life, while an integrated MP3 player, FM radio and video recording/playback capabilities help stimulate your senses during downtime.  
With a large touch screen display and Motorola’s advanced handwriting recognition, it’s easy to communicate – whether you are sending or receiving SMS or e-mail. Text entry is as easy as using the stylus to write directly on the 2.2” interactive screen.  
The only drawback is Motorola batteries aren’t good also the phone need to be handled with care you don’t want to ruin your touchscreen, one fall and its gone.

Price- Rs7499
