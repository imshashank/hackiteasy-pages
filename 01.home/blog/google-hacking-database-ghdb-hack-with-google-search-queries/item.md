Google Hacking Database or GHDB as they call it.. Ya Google can help u get over some site, and reveal a lot information much more than you ever thought.  
Once i imagined google got the biggest crawlers an databases its huge. So how much information it would have about all who ever were on Internet. It might be a threat for me and could very well harm me.  
They made a global community that contributed such queries But instead of being outrooted that community grew up and has over 60,000 members now and also got over 1500 such queries.  
  
And here’s a list of attacks and search methds that reveal a lot of information.  
These include-

- Vulnerabiliies
- Password files
- Usernames
- 
- Sensitive Data
- Vulnerable Files
- Vulnerable Servers
- And Much More……

I found this list on  
<http://johnny.ihackstuff.com/ghdb.php>  
Here’s a few content from the site..  
Keep it up johny !!

These searches locate vulnerable servers. These searches are often generated from various security advisory posts, and in many cases are product or version-specific. [Error Messages](http://www.blogger.com/ghdb.php?function=summary&cat=10) (68 entries)
