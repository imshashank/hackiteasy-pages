But still i had to do a lot of work in this.. And still the update process is going on. The worst part of this template is that it is not blogger friendly and the Page Element thing don’t work at all. So i had to use all my HTML skills to carve this up.  
Also do tell us how’s the new look . About any bugs or errors.  
I would like to thank http://woork.blogspot.com for this..
