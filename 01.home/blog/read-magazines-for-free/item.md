This is a very simple & non-geeky trick to help you read the latest issue of popular magazines like PC Magazine, MIT Technology Review, Popular Mechanics, MacWorld, Lonely Planet, Reader’s Digest, etc without paying any subscription charges.  
You will also get to read adult magazines like Playboy and Penthouse. Best of all, these digital magazines are exact replicas of print and served as high-resolution images that you can also download on to the computer for offline reading.  
How to Read Online Magazines for Free  
Step 1: If you are on a Windows PC, go to [apple.com](http://www.apple.com/safari/download/) and download the Safari browser. Mac users already have Safari on their system.  
Step 2: Once you install Safari, go to Edit -> Preferences -> Advanced and check the option that says “Show Develop menu in menu bar.”  
Step 3: Open the “Develop” option in the browser menu bar and choose Mobile Safari 1.1.3 – iPhone as the User Agent.

Step 4: You’re all set. Open [zinio.com/iphone](http://imgs.zinio.com/iphone/) inside Safari browser and start reading your favorite magazines for free. Use the navigation arrows at the top to turn pages.  
For people in countries like India who are already subscribed to Zinio Digital Magazines, this hack is still useful because you get access to certain magazines which are otherwise not available for subscription via Zinio (e.g., Penthouse and Playboy).  
Geeks may write a AutoHotKey script or create a “scrolling capture” profile in SnagIt that will auto-flip magazine pages and save all the images locally.
