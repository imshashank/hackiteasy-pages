Updated: 10th Nov 2011 Well as I already mentioned u can hack any system as it is conected to what we call INTERNET . To connect internet a system allocates a port for communication and Data Transfer. SO here it goes all we goto do is get into that port thats hacking.  
  
steps: –

1.Download software [PORT SCANNER](http://www.download.com/Advanced-Port-Scanner/3000-2085-10127846.html). Also you could use port scanner from Nettools. Download link on my blog or just Google for it  
2.Copy the IP address of the victim whose port is open.  
3.Download NETLAB which gives you all information including the victim ip address and area from where he is accessing internet.  
4.Paste the ip of victim u found initially into NETLAB .Thats it u access his system.

[Click here to download NETLAB](http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5458042/Netlab_1.4_%5BEasyHack%5D%5BHell13oY%5D) (torrent link from piratebay.org) ***
