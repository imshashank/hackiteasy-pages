This intelligent codec software package has all the codecs you will ever need on you Vista machine. Codecs have been a problem for most users at one time or another. This is because there has never been an ‘out of the box’ working solution that the average computer user could install and just have everything work properly from the beginning.  
  
The installer will automatically remove most other popular codec releases from your computer before installing this concise yet comprehensive package. You won’t need to make any adjustments or tweaks to enjoy your media content immediately. Windows Media Player and Vista’s Media Center will instantly recognize all your files as playable.
