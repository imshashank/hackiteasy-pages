Recently i got a chance to hand on an Iphone the gadget of my dreams. I just loved the way we could use Iphone. Its so simple yet amazingly astonishing. Truly the best part is that it has no keys the touch-screen is the bestest i would have ever seen. Its really easy to use.Also the built in Ipod is superb alongwith good quality camera.I just love it hope to own one of it soonâ€¦..See the video

Also iphone got a whole bunch of applications made exclusively for it. The best part was the image viewer the way we scroll through it and zoom into pictures.
