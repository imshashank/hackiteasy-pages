[Daphne](http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Daphne-Download-26744.html) is a free application much like the Windows Task Manager, [![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_V2JZuLkPrjQ/SPM5cOjF8ZI/AAAAAAAAD7w/9zdthof63ws/s320/Daphne--thumb.png)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_V2JZuLkPrjQ/SPM5cOjF8ZI/AAAAAAAAD7w/9zdthof63ws/s1600-h/Daphne--thumb.png)except it got more features.  
With[ Daphne](http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Daphne-Download-26744.html) you get a small icon in the Task bar and each time you click it, it shows the list of currently running applications. To end any just select that application and select Delete from keyboard. Saves a lot of time and useless headaches as well.  
Daphne also got a lot of built in tools like you can close any window or block/disable any application. It gets really easy with Daphyne to manage applications.
