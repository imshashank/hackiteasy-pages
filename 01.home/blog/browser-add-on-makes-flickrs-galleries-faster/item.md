Browser add-on [Flickr Gallery Plus](http://www.robertnyman.com/flickrgalleryplus/) adds extended functionality to [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/)‘s set view, allowing users to click through to see full versions of each shot without having to reload the page. Once installed it will go out and pre-fetch the larger sized version of each shot, making big sets a cinch to speed through. This includes the addition of keyboard shortcuts (something you can’t get in Flickr without a [Greasemonkey script](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/1708)) which lets you go back and forth between shots using your arrow keys.

In addition to its thumbnail optimizer, the add-on includes a simple slideshow viewer that doesn’t attempt to replace Flickr’s own gorgeous slideshow tool. Instead, it simply fades together the pre-fetched pictures without leaving the page. You can set how long you want each photo to be displayed, anywhere from one to five seconds.

If you’re a heavy Flickr user this extension is definitely worth the download as it will cut your page loads in half. It retains Flickr’s slideshow tools and its same navigation; you also have the option to turn it on and off from a setting at the bottom of your browser.

Note: As with all experimental Firefox add-ons, you must be registered with [Mozilla’s Firefox add-ons site](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) to download it. It’s also [available as a Greasemonkey script](http://code.google.com/p/flickrgalleryplus/downloads/list).
