The few best ones are describe below.[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_V2JZuLkPrjQ/SPNEaVV85OI/AAAAAAAAD84/Fk9iEWntH94/s320/reddit.com.header.png)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_V2JZuLkPrjQ/SPNEaVV85OI/AAAAAAAAD84/Fk9iEWntH94/s1600-h/reddit.com.header.png)

  
[Stumbleupon](http://www.stumbleupon.com/)[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_V2JZuLkPrjQ/SPNEadZ_NEI/AAAAAAAAD9I/qmCNjPH_Zzo/s320/stumbleupon.png)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_V2JZuLkPrjQ/SPNEadZ_NEI/AAAAAAAAD9I/qmCNjPH_Zzo/s1600-h/stumbleupon.png)  
The best one for easy surfing. It got separate tools for searching sites, blogs, pictures, videos..and more. It also has a toolbar addon that lets you surf more easily. Stumbleupon lets you rate and save pages you like and would love to read, also you can create a blog on stumbleupon to show your favorite pages and share with other users on the site.

Fark](http://www.fark.com/)

Fark is completely based on link sh[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_V2JZuLkPrjQ/SPNEaRSupAI/AAAAAAAAD8w/ihattmceY0A/s320/farkLogo2.gif)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_V2JZuLkPrjQ/SPNEaRSupAI/AAAAAAAAD8w/ihattmceY0A/s1600-h/farkLogo2.gif)aring and could also be used to generate a bit of traffic. But Fark is good and lets you search sites and read stuff that you would like.

[Digg](http://www.digg.com/)[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_V2JZuLkPrjQ/SPNEaVkvmjI/AAAAAAAAD8o/w2YFOglSMKk/s320/digg.gif)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_V2JZuLkPrjQ/SPNEaVkvmjI/AAAAAAAAD8o/w2YFOglSMKk/s1600-h/digg.gif)
