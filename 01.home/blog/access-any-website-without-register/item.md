###  

 Get free access to websites without registering..This simple hack lets you access any website without registering to it.It gives you a ID/Username and a password that was used by some other user to login into the site..

Go to  
<http://bugmenot.com/>  
and type the URL of the website you want to log into.

Examples:  
–<http://www.nytimes.com/>, –[http://www.winnetmag.com](http://www.winnetmag.com/)/ etcetera.

Another (and better) way is changing the user agent of your browser to:  
Googlebot/2.1+  
–<http://www.googlebot.com/bot.html>  
This is very easy in Mozilla’s Firefox. Download and install the User Agent Switcher from  
-http://www.chrispederick.com/work/firefox/useragentswitcher/  
and add the Googlebot user agent.

Go to our new site- shankee.com
