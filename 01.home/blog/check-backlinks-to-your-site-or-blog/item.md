Google ranks you based on your popularity , that’s the no. of backlinks you have. The more you have that means more people are recommending you.  
Backlink.

**Backlinks** (or back-links (UK)) are incoming links to a website or web page. In the search engine optimization (SEO) world, the number of backlinks is one indication of the popularity or importance of that website or page (though other measures, such as PageRank, are likely to be more important). Outside of SEO, the backlinks of a webpage may be of significant personal, cultural or semantic interest: they indicate who is paying attention to that page.
