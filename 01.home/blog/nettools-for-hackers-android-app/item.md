[!["NetTools" for Android](http://35.160.74.13/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Fullscreen-capture-4132012-34748-AM.jpg ""NetTools" for Android")](http://35.160.74.13/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Fullscreen-capture-4132012-34748-AM.jpg)[NetTools](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.shashank.NetTools "NetTools for Android."): Network Tool Suite for hackers & network admins. This is a compilation of different utilities used by network admins in daily chores.

[NetTools ](http://users.telenet.be/ahmadi/nettools.htm "NetTools for Windows")was inspired from the NetTools software by “ahmadi” which found a rife use by hackers and network administrators. NetTools is an utility suite.  
It has many apps to help network admins to monitor and test sites. The first version has the following tools:-   
\* IP Resolver   
\* Whois   
\* Website Source Viewer   
\* Port Scanner   
\* Hexadecimal to Binary &  Decimal converter   
\* Ping

 The app is free to download from the Play Store (Android Market).  NetTools is under construction and will host a much larger number of tools in the future. Install on Android from [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.shashank.NetTools "NetTools for Android.").

If you want to contribute to the code do contact us.
