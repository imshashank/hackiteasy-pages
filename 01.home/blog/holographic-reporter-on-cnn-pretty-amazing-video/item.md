It was US elections and yes Obama won but we arenâ€™t blogging about that, we have millions talking about him actually but i just came across this awesome news. A reporter was shown as in hologram and it appeared as if she was there, even when she was very far away. This is like some of the very first examples of the very first use of Holograms.  
  
She just looked so real, as reported they were delivering news on the US election. Ans the female reporter was shown as a hologram she was totally virtual even when she was somewhere else in some other studio. She appeared as if she was just standing next to the male reporter. For this 35 cameras were used to capture her from every angle responsible. See the amazing video on this..
