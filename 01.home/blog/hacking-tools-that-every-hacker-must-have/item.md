We(hackiteasy.com) present another list of the must hacking tools every hacker must have. These toolsmake the life of a hacker much easier and every n00b must first learn how to use these tools first.

**AIRCRACK**

Aircrack-ng is an 802.11 WEP and WPA-PSK keys cracking program that can recover keys once enough data packets have been captured. It implements the standard FMS attack along with some optimizations like KoreK attacks, as well as the all-new PTW attack, thus making the attack much faster compared to other WEP cracking tools. In fact, Aircrack-ng is a set of tools for auditing wireless networks.

**BackTrack**

BackTrack is a A Linux Distribution focused on penetration testing.

**BarsWF**

BarsWF is the worlds fastest md5 bruteforcing password cracker, just in case you didn’t already know.  
It combines using your computers processor with you graphics cards GPU for computing the largest amount of hashes as quickly as possible. It is not unheard of to get 100’s of millions of hashes per second when using this application.

Prerequisites which really dont need to be mentioned are a processor with SSE2 instruction set, and any nvidia geforce 8 and up graphics card with CUDA support if you want the really fast one, otherwise most decently new nvidia graphics cards bought in the past 2 years should be able to work with this.

**BLOODSHED IDE**

Bloodshed IDE is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for the C/C++ programming language.

**CAIN AND ABEL**

Cain and Abel is a Windows password cracker, capable of cracking a variety of hashes, as well as arp poisoning, sniffing the network, etc.. to obtain those password hashes in the first place.

**CANVAS**

Immunity’s CANVAS makes available hundreds of exploits, an automated exploitation system, and a comprehensive, reliable exploit development framework to penetration testers and security professionals worldwide. To see CANVAS in action please see the movies at immunitysec.com

Supported Platforms and Installations  
\# Windows (requires Python & PyGTK)  
\# Linux  
\# MacOSX (requires PyGTK)  
\# All other Python environments such as mobile phones and commercial Unixes (command line version only supported, GUI may also be available)

Exploits  
\# currently over 400 exploits, an average of 4 exploits added every monthly release  
\# Immunity carefully selects vulnerabilities for inclusion as CANVAS exploits. Top priorities are high-value vulnerabilities such as remote, pre-authentication, and new vulnerabilities in mainstream software.  
\# Exploits span all common platforms and applications

Payload Options  
\# to provide maximum reliability, exploits always attempt to reuse socket  
\# if socket reuse is not suitable, connect-back is used  
\# subsequent MOSDEF session allows arbitrary code execution, and provides a listener shell for common actions (file management, screenshots, etc)  
\# bouncing and split-bouncing automatically available via MOSDEF  
\# adjustable covertness level

Ability to make Custom Exploits  
\# unique MOSDEF development environment allows rapid exploit development

Development  
\# CANVAS is a platform that is designed to allow easy development of other security products. Examples include Gleg, Ltd’s VulnDisco and the Argeniss Ultimate 0day Exploits Pack.

**CYGWIN**

Cygwin is the next best thing to using Linux.  
I personally do not use a windows box period, work, school, or other, unless I have Cygwin installed.  
It’s a large download, but once you get use to using it there’s no turning back.  
I have actually created a condensed copy that I carry around on my flash drive.  
It comes complete with most Unix/Linux commands, to include the ability to compile things on the fly with gcc, perl, etc..  
It has many useful things about it, but the only way to really see the extent of them is to use it yourself unless you like reading pages of technical data to help put you to sleep at night.

FYI…Last I checked it was currently managed by RedHat.

**DBAN**

DBAN- Short for Darik’s Boot and Nuke, is a good utility for securely erasing contents of hard disk.  
It uses encryption and re-writing over drives multiple times for a fairly secure deletion which makes if very difficult if not impossible to recover using forensics.

**FARONICS DEEP FREEZE**

Faronics Deep Freeze helps eliminate workstation damage and downtime by making computer configurations indestructible. Once Deep Freeze is installed on a workstation, any changes made to the computer—regardless of whether they are accidental or malicious—are never permanent. Deep Freeze provides immediate immunity from many of the problems that “He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.” computers today—inevitable configuration drift, accidental system misconfiguration, malicious software activity, and incidental system degradation.

Deep Freeze ensures computers are absolutely bulletproof, even when users have full access to system software and settings. Users get to enjoy a pristine and unrestricted computing experience, while IT personnel are freed from tedious helpdesk requests, constant system maintenance, and continuous configuration drift.

**NESSUS**

Nessus has been around for a little more than a little while now and has gone from free to almost free to it’s gonna cost ya.  
I’m not really sure regarding the newest updates as I haven’t used it since it lost it’s freedom, but I will say it has plugins for everything under the sun!  
It is mainly used for network and server scanning and has the ability to test and create a client/server connection between yourself and the host you’re testing with.

**RAINBOW CRACK**

RainbowCrack is a general propose implementation of Philippe Oechslin’s faster time-memory trade-off technique.  
In short, the RainbowCrack tool is a hash cracker. A traditional brute force cracker try all possible plaintexts one by one in cracking time. It is time consuming to break complex password in this way. The idea of time-memory trade-off is to do all cracking time mabait in advance and store the result in files so called “rainbow table”. It does take a long time to precompute the tables. But once the one time mabait is finished, a time-memory trade-off cracker can be hundreds of times faster than a brute force cracker, with the help of precomputed tables.

**UNETBOOTIN**

UNetbootin – An application to install an operating system to a flash drive or to a hard disk by either using the pre-downloaded iso file or by downloading the operating system through the application.

**WPE PRO**

Winsock Packet Editor (WPE) Pro is a packet sniffing/editing tool which is generally used to hack multiplayer games. WPE Pro allows modification of data at TCP level. Using WPE Pro one can select a running process from the memory and modify the data sent by it before it reaches the destination. It can record packets from specific processes, then analyze the information. You can setup filters to modify the packets or even send them when you want in different intervals. WPE Pro could also be a useful tool for testing thick client applications or web applications which use applets to establish socket connections on non http ports.
