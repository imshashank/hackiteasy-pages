Ever tried dowloading those drivers(madwifi), or installing so many software on a linux for wireless testing and penetration. Now you won’t have to sweat it out. Wifi [Slax](http://www.shankee.com/2011/01/building-your-own-linux-with-slax.html)‘s team does it for you.

[WifiSlax ](http://www.wifislax.com/)is a type of Slax OS made exclusively for wireless hacking. It comes with a bunch of wireless tools preloaded into it. These include Aircrack, Airsnort, kismet, madwifi drivers and many more…

When we tried using one of those we came to know that the distro is made in spain and thus all of its content was in Spanish but to no worries we translated that and the language of Linux is same all over so it proved to be no big problem.
