New Delhi, Aug 28 (IANS) The government Thursday said the auction for allotment of 3G spectrum will begin by October-end, while services will roll out this year.

‘Auction of the 3G spectrum will begin by the end of October, and I plan to roll out services by the end of this year,’ Communications and Information Technology Minister A. Raja said at a function here.

‘Since the availability of spectrum in 3G space for CDMA operators has increased and so has competition, we are allowing more than one operator in this space,’ he added.

Till date, Reliance Communication was the only contender in the 3G CDMA space on account of its high subscriber base. With Raja’s latest announcement, other operators too can place bids.
