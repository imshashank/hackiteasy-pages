The CNET blog launched a contest asking users for asking about the best tech gift this thanksgiving and Black Friday. Just need to ask them a live question during the live streaming on November 28, 2008–or “Black Friday”–for the 2008 Holiday Help Desk live on [CNET TV](http://reviews.cnet.com/holiday-gift-guide/holiday-helpdesk/www.cnettv.com).
