and in [![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_V2JZuLkPrjQ/SMf37CutwNI/AAAAAAAACzk/DkSFEGsGAQI/s320/Safari.jpg)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_V2JZuLkPrjQ/SMf37CutwNI/AAAAAAAACzk/DkSFEGsGAQI/s1600-h/Safari.jpg)the meantime we have completely [![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_V2JZuLkPrjQ/SMf37SM5rzI/AAAAAAAACz0/_cZzY76t08U/s320/Epiphany_logo_64px.png)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_V2JZuLkPrjQ/SMf37SM5rzI/AAAAAAAACz0/_cZzY76t08U/s1600-h/Epiphany_logo_64px.png)forgotten old browsers.  
Here’s a list of the famous browsers that are used popularly…  
  
1.[ Internet Explorer](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/internet-explorer/beta/default.aspx)[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_V2JZuLkPrjQ/SMf37A6VJzI/AAAAAAAACzs/HABJQHE6YN8/s320/IE.jpg)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_V2JZuLkPrjQ/SMf37A6VJzI/AAAAAAAACzs/HABJQHE6YN8/s1600-h/IE.jpg)  
The King in the world of internet. Microsoft’s browser it still has the world’s largest share of users. Recently IE-8 was launched, it again came in the spotlight. It’s faster…and has more features than any other browser (except Firefox). But the worst part it’s a property of Microsoft and they use it mostly for their own use such as spreading Windows..But that’s OK..

2.[Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/)[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_V2JZuLkPrjQ/SMf2sMNRK5I/AAAAAAAACzE/cyXkOJ2Gpy0/s320/images.jpg)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_V2JZuLkPrjQ/SMf2sMNRK5I/AAAAAAAACzE/cyXkOJ2Gpy0/s1600-h/images.jpg)  
It’s the second most use browser. And potentially the biggest threat to IE(Microsoft). It has a huge user base. It’s completely open-source and hence loved by Linux people and is almost used with every Linux OS. It has a huge no. of Add-ons and features, A trick to improve its speed available at my blog. The Firefox’s latest version created a record for the highest no. of online downloads by any software.

The Official Google browser. It is recently lauched and caused a turnmoil in the computer world. Still i have no Idea why google intended to launch the browser as it alreay helps Firefox or it amy be a part of Anti-Microsoft campaign. Whatever it may be but the browser’s really simple and lack a lot of features, waiting for its’ update. But still has a lot of great features like the direct search from address bar..and many more..[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_V2JZuLkPrjQ/SMf2Og-AZFI/AAAAAAAACyk/FkbcvW-0EjY/s320/opera96.jpg)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_V2JZuLkPrjQ/SMf2Og-AZFI/AAAAAAAACyk/FkbcvW-0EjY/s1600-h/opera96.jpg)

9.[AOL Explorer](http://downloads.channel.aol.com/browser)  
AOL Explorer, previously known as AOL Browser is a graphical web browser based on the Microsoft Trident layout engine and was released by AOL. In July 2005, AOL launched AOL Explorer as a free download and as an optional download with AIM version 5.9. AOL Explorer supports tabbed browsing.

10.[K-Meleon](http://kmeleon.sourceforge.net/)[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_V2JZuLkPrjQ/SMf2OCvORXI/AAAAAAAACyU/1jSf0qsa8tU/s320/K-Meleon_Logo.png)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_V2JZuLkPrjQ/SMf2OCvORXI/AAAAAAAACyU/1jSf0qsa8tU/s1600-h/K-Meleon_Logo.png)  
K-Meleon is a web browser for the Microsoft Windows platform. Based on the same Gecko layout engine as Mozilla Firefox, K-Meleon uses native Windows API to create the user interface (instead of using Mozilla’s cross-platform XUL layer), and as a result, is tightly integrated into the look and feel of the Windows desktop;[1] this approach is similar to that of Galeon and Epiphany (for the GNOME desktop), and Camino (for Mac OS X). This also makes K-Meleon less resource-intensive and more responsive to user input.

11.[Avant Browser](http://www.avantbrowser.com/)  
Avant Browser is a popular freeware web browser from a Chinese programmer named Anderson Che, which unites the Trident layout engine built into Windows (see Internet Explorer shell) with an interface intended to be more feature-rich, flexible and ergonomic than Microsoft’s Internet Explorer (IE). It runs on Windows 98 and above, including Windows Vista. Internet Explorer version 6 or 7 must be installed.
