Recently my PC was struck by a virus after much hassle i was able to remove it from my system but the Virus disabled my Task Manager. [![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_V2JZuLkPrjQ/SRmoHEQiP8I/AAAAAAAAEgk/31WMt4uONyQ/s320/taskmgrdis.jpg)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_V2JZuLkPrjQ/SRmoHEQiP8I/AAAAAAAAEgk/31WMt4uONyQ/s1600-h/taskmgrdis.jpg)So i was much worried about that, but i found a simple and cool software that let me enable my virus disabled task manager. It was simply great.

When you get a virus that disabled your Taskmanager each time you try to open it something like this is shown. Saying ” Task Manager has been disabled by your administrator”. Simple tool to fix it.

[Click here ](http://www.dougknox.com/xp/utils/xp_taskmgrenab.zip)to download the software. Extract it using WinRAR or Winzip and just run it.

Its so simple yet so cool.

Virus disables your Task Manager by editing your registry files i also had a tutorial that tells you how to edit them and get back that TASKMANAGER but i supposed the software proved to be much more simpler but if you also wanna know about the registry edit stuff write you email in the comments.
