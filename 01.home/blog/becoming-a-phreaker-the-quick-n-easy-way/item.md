 | Becoming A Phreaker |

 +———————+

 |The Quick n’ Easy Way|

 ———————/

 /————-

 ————-/

So, you want to be a phreaker, and you want to do it the Quick ‘n Easy

Way, eh? Well, no fear, your obdn’t servant, NightJoker is here! if

you’ve been a wannabe phreaker for years, but don’t have the patience

or know-how to make some of the more advanced boxes, this is for you.

This file will show how to make one of the easiest boxes, which will

make your life fun, and your enemies cringe (OK, maybe not \*cringe\*

exactly, more like be really pissed off…). Using readily availible

parts from your nearest Radio Shack, you too can be up there with the

ranks of Cap’n Crunch (well, you’d actually have to do something pretty

damn daring or revoulutionary, but practice, practice, practice!).

Notice the lack of ALL CAPS or an³n®oy#¶ing giÈœbbðÛeriÆsh. This is

easy to read, easy to follow, and lots of phun. I’ve done my best to

make it so that the instructions can be followed if some of the the

ASCII art gets fucked up in the transfer. Just wing it.

The BEIGE Box

The beige box is the primary source of entertainment for the phreaker.

With some experience, you can successfully make long distance phone

calls, obscene/prank calls, and other stuff, all on someone else’s

bill. The beige box is simply a ripoff linemans handset. You know, the

bright orange ones that you see linemans holding while they cling to a

telephone pole? But of course, no phreaker in their right mind is going

to climb up a pole! You’re going to stay nice and safe on the ground.

All this is is a normal phone with a special cable. Simple.

The construction:

 Now using the minimmum of parts, you could create a basic beige

box.

(1) Phone cable with the wires color-coded

(1) Telephone

(2) Alligator clips, green and red.

It’s best to use an X-Acto-style knife, or a utility knife.

Now, find a phone cable (the one that goes between the wall and phone,

not the handset cable). It should be a couple feet long. Carefully

slice it open near on plug – do it slowly, and not too deep, so that

you dont cut any wires. Peel it open slightly, and if you see several

wires that are colored, great. If all you see is some wires that aren’t

colored, forget it, that’ll be too hard (tape it up with some scotch

tape, maybe your mom won’t notice).

Now that you’ve found your cable, cut off one end, a few inches from

the connector. Save this connector (with a few inches of cable) for

later. Slice the covering back 3-4 inches, and cut it off, leaving the

colored wires intact. There sould be four wires – red, green, black,

and yellow. To be able to use the wire for other things later, tape

the black and yellow paralell to the cable, so they won’t get into the

way. Now, strip abot a half an inch of the red and green wires. To

strip it, take your knife, and lay the cable on a hard table. Take the

red wire, and press it to the table with your finger, about 2 inches

from the end. Taking the knife, position it about a half an inch from

the end, the point on the wire. Slowly and gently, swipe the knife AWAY

from you, towards the end of the wire. You should make a thin cut

along the wire. If you have not cut all the way through, do it again.

Carefully separate the wire from the insulation. You should have a

wire, with the end splitting into a piece of insulation and a piece of

wire. Cut off the insulation – dont cut the wire! Do the same thing

for the green wire.

Now, you should have a phone cable, with a connector at one end, and a

sripped green and red wire at the other end.

Go to the nearest electronic store. They should sell little baggies of

alligator clips with colored plastic sheathes – make sure they don’t

have wire attatched to them. These cost about $1.50. Buy (or

otherwise get) a bag that has a red and green clip. Now, take your red

and green clips, and slip the sheathe off of them. They should slide

right off, and leave the metal clip that has a small screw attatched to

it, or a tab with a hole in it. Unscrew the screw until there is

enough space to wrap the wire around it. Wrap the properly colored wire

around it, and screw it in. Or, stick the wire in the tab, and wrap it

around a few times, until ther is no stripped wire left.Give it a

little tug to see if it’s secure. Put the sheathe back on. Do it to

the other wire. OK, you now have a phone cord, that has a plug at

one end, and a red

and green alligator clip, attached to the same colored wires, at the

other end. Your’re done!

NOTE: If you (A) can’t find the right cable, or (B) are too damn lazy,

Radio Shack sells cables with a standard phone connector at one end,

and spade lugs connected to the colored wires at the other end. Just

cut off the connecors, and strip the wires.

How to use it:

How old is your house? If it was built or if the phone system was

upgraded within the last 20 years, go to the side of the house where

your gas and electrical meters are. You should find the power box

(where the breakers are) that wierd things with all the pipes and a

meter (the gas thingie), and, maybe, a grey box with some wires

attatched to it. Now, this might be your cable hookup, but if there’s

a Bell logo on it, that’s probably it. If you can’t find it, look in

the backyard. Once you’ve found it, see if there is some sort of bolt

on it. If it dosen’t have one, reach under the box, and find the edge

of the cover. Grab it, and pull down and out. It should open up. If

it dosen’t, try the sides, or the top. If it sitll dosen’t, look again

for a bolt. If there is one, go to the handy-dandy hardware store, and

get yourself a 7/16 inch hex driver. This should open up the box.

This can also be used to open up other kinds of telco switch boxes.

Once you have it open, you may see several things:

= Four wires, red, green, black, and yellow, hooked up to four posts by

a screw.

= A bunch of wires – look for the red, green, black, and yellow ones.

= If you live in an apartment building, a bunch of rows of plastic,

with metal tabs sticking out of them. There should be wires coming out

of most of the tabs, that are colored red, green, black, and yellow.

They should be labeld with apartment numbers or phone numbers. Look

for yours.

= One or two thick cables, connected to something else. This is a

cable box, bozo. If you want free cable, figure it out.

= A shitload of spiders. Get the RAID.

Now, get a phone – the ones that are the “slimline” kind are the best,

or the kind that are just a handset, and no base are better. Plug your

modified cable into this. Making sure that the switch for the handset

is down, clip the red clip to the post/terminal witht the red wire.

This is the RING terminal. It’s usually on the right – remember the

phreakers adage: ring-red-right. Connect the green clip to the green

wired post/terminal. Make sure they are firmly attached, and not

touching any other wires. Now, pick the phone up, and (hopefully) you

should hear a dial tone. If not, adjust the clips (can’t touch any

other posts, remember!). If that dosen’t work, then switch the clips

(if that’s the problem, just switch the colored insulation on the

clips).
