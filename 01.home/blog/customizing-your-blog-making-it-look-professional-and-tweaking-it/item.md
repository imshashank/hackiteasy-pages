So now u have a blog..if u don’t just read the post posted just before this post…  
Now wat u wish is to attract traffic to your blog and also earn from ur blog..  
i write the full procedure in full steps down here…  
The first step being changing the layout…

**Changing the layout**

  
The first thing is to change your layout. As the free templates from Blogger are just so non-professional. To do that you need a layout HTML code..  
there area many sites offering custom made layouts for free..a few of them are here..

You can look for yourself in google ( go to google and search for ” free 3 column blogger”).  
Open the layout file in Notepad and copy the whole code..  
Noe to put that to your blogger template go to your blogger Dashboard…  
Then click on Layout..click on Edit HTML..  
now before you do any change to your HTML back it up before. Blogger gives u an option of Downloading the Full tmplate lick on that.  
Now after you have done that go to Edit html and in the Box where you see the HTML code of ur blog ..Select all of it..and press Delete..  
Now paste the new HTML of the layout you wish to change it to..  
And click on SAVE..  
It its successful its says u to view blog..  
If not don’t worry some HTML may not work due to improper coding try other ones…  
And if any problem arises contact me..  
When this is done you have your new blog layout..

Do comment on this ..how u liked it or not..  
More to come soon…of the making blog series..
