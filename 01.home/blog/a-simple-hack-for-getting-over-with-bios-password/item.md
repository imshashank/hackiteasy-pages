This simple trick would let you access your PC in case you forget the BIOS password..  
The simple easy trick you must know.. might not work on a few systems!!  
But works fine on most..

Here is the best way to crack the bios password in win 95/98/XP:

Follow the steps below:

1) Boot up windows.  
2) go to dos-prompt or go to command prompt directly from the windows start up menu.  
3) type the command at the prompt: “debug” (without quotes )  
4) type the following lines now exactly as given…….  
o 70 10  
o 71 20  
quit  
exit

4) exit from the dos prompt and restart the machine

password protection gone!!!!!!!!!!!!!

EnjoYYYYYYYYYY

PS: I tested this in Award Bios……..  
There seems to be some issue regarding display drivers on some machines if this is used. Just reinstall the drivers, Everything will be fine………..

I have not found any other trouble if the codes are used.

To be on safe side, just back up your data……….

The use of this code is entirely at ur risk………. It worked fine for me……….
