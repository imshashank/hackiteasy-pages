Long ago when i started to know about Internet, [![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_V2JZuLkPrjQ/SfGbD0b_YWI/AAAAAAAAHQM/fnk024W-g9M/s320/101390_geo1-600.jpg)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_V2JZuLkPrjQ/SfGbD0b_YWI/AAAAAAAAHQM/fnk024W-g9M/s1600-h/101390_geo1-600.jpg)the first thing that i knew of free web hosting was Geocities. It was yahoo who offered free web hosting.  
But due to some unknown reason its closed now. We have no definite reason for its closure but as rumors say it was stiff competition, better options and to focus on other products.  
GeoCities was once known for pioneering the personal portal era where anyone could build up their own personal pages. GeoCities got acquired by Yahoo! for $2.87 billion in 1999. However, the service suffered badly in the last eight years or so as blogging platforms evolved and the website-creating and hosting services gradually became cheaper.

But whatever it has been we all will miss Geocities the site that made all dream come true of owing a site.
