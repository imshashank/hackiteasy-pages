Anonymity is cool and necessary when you want to hide your identity on the web, especially for hackers.  
Well, this is a simple tool for hackers to make Firefox and Ubuntu Anonymous. To install Tor just download it via apt-get on ubuntu (debian)-

just type-

> *sudo apt-get install tor*

When installed also install “vidalia”. This tool manages tor and is GUI.

> *sudo apt-get install vidalia*

Now open vidalia by typing

> *sudo vidalia*

Turn tor on, now you can use this to anonymous connection.

But still this won’t make the browsers anonymous for this download a small plugin for firefox.

Just click here to install tor in Firefox (tor not available for other browsers)-

<https://www.torproject.org/dist/torbutton/torbutton-current.xpi>

[or go here – https://www.torproject.org/torbutton/index.html.en](http://www.blogger.com/or%20go%20here%20-%20https://www.torproject.org/torbutton/index.html.en)

Then after the plugin you will see a “red” icon next to address bar. Just click it and “toggle” mode.

The icon will become green, now again check your IP in the browser.

Hack it Easy 🙂
