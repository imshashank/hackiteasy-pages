The war of the Browsers have grown and we focus on the leader of the web. Google’s Chrome has been much talked about but is it really that good or the Emperor of the browsers Microsoft’s Internet Explorer makes to be the best. Or is it the open-source and freely developed Firefox proves to be the best browser in all. or does Apple’s Safari makes it big. We see in this video the fight of the Internet browsers. We are soory but Opera has not been included..  
  
They scored the browsers based on the following 4 features…  
1. Speed  
2. Security  
3. Customization  
4. Killer feature

This could have been better.. Firefox is the ultimate winner in this one…See the embeded video..
