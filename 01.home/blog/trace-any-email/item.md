Terror strikes again in India and it’s the Delhi blast this time, followed by a terror mail. And that traced back to some unsecured wifi connection.  
In all this one thing struck in my mind how do they traced the location of the email. And just with a few efforts i found out how !!  
It’s so simple than i actually thought. The main key lies in the email’s header. To see the full header there are a few options in all Email clients , Like you go to Full Header in Yahoo mail, Go to help in your mail client or mail me if you cant configure how to know your mail’s header.  
For knowing any email’s place you just need to know the full header.  
It looks something like this..  
  
Sample Email Headers:

Return-path:   
Received: from mac.com ([10.13.11.252])  
 by ms031.mac.com (Sun Java System Messaging Server 6.2-8.04 (built Feb 28  
 2007)) with ESMTP id for user@example.com; Thu,  
 09 Aug 2007 04:24:50 -0700 (PDT)  
Received: from mail.dsis.net (mail.dsis.net [70.183.59.5])  
 by mac.com (Xserve/smtpin22/MantshX 4.0) with ESMTP id l79BOnNS000101  
 for ; Thu, 09 Aug 2007 04:24:49 -0700 (PDT)  
Received: from [192.168.2.77] (70.183.59.6) by mail.dsis.net with ESMTP  
 (EIMS X 3.3.2) for ; Thu, 09 Aug 2007 04:24:49 -0700  
Date: Thu, 09 Aug 2007 04:24:57 -0700  
From: Frank Sender   
Subject: Test  
To: Joe User   
Message-id:   
MIME-version: 1.0 (Apple Message framework v752.2)  
X-Mailer: Apple Mail (2.752.2)  
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII; format=flowed  
Content-transfer-encoding: 7bit

If you don’t unerstand what the various lines and numbers mean don’t get worried. As u don’t need to know what it means.  
So here’s how u know what is the location..  
Go to here…[  
http://www.ip-adress.com/trace\_email/#result](http://www.ip-adress.com/trace_email/#result)

And paste the full Header into the space provided..  
It was the best one i could have seen. I tried some other sites as well but they didn’t gave fine results.  
Also this would give u an IP  
That would look like this -118.101.28.5  
So here’s the loation of the computer that has this IP address..  
So to know more about it go here…[  
http://www.geobytes.com/IpLocator.htm?GetLocation](http://www.geobytes.com/IpLocator.htm?GetLocation)  
And paste the IP..  
It tells you the most exact and clean results..

Here’s how u too become a techie and trace the location of any email source.  
But still as it’s so easy to trace its even more easier to prevent yourself from getting traced..  
There are 1000s of tricks that let you hide your IP from anyone…  
Hope out Indian Tech Expert know that..before Terrorists know about this…
