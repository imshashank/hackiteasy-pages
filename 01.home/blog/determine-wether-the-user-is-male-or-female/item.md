If you want to know if some user is male or female just by opening a simple site on his computer, isnt it cool..  
[Estimate Gender](http://www.mikeonads.com/2008/07/13/using-your-browser-url-history-estimate-gender/)  
See this it runs a simple script that determines on the method of browsing wether the user was male or female. It uses browsing history and follows a simple algorithm.  
It gave me 85% male and 15 % female..

There’s another tool that determines whether a site is written be male or a female..[  
Gender Analyser](http://www.genderanalyzer.com/)  
Its cool…  
Its funny it showed Haknit is written by Female…??  
I am quite surprised…!!
